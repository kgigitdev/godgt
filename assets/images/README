This directory contains pre-rendered PNG images for chess pieces at
various useful resolutions, as well as source SVG files.

Images exist for both light and dark backgrounds; for example, "BQL"
and "BQD" mean "Black Queen, Light" and "Black Queen, Dark"
respectively.

The source for all these files was the Merida TrueType font, released
as freeware in 1998 by Armando Hernandez Marroquin.

The individual SVG files were created manually from the original
TrueType font using fontforge.

The SVG files were then processed into PNG files using inkscape in
command-line mode; for example:

    inkscape \
        --without-gui \
        --file BQD.svg \
        --export-png BQD.128.png \
        --export-width 128 \
        --export-height 128

Or, using terse options:

    inkscape -z -f BQD.svg -e BQD.128.png -w 128 -h 128

Note that inkscape does uses antialiasing when converting, which means
that the .png files are somewhat larger than they could be, but look
nicer as a result.
